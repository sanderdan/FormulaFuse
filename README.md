A simple Android/iOS app made in [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com/) with news and information about Formula 1.

## Description
This is a project I'll keep updating as I'm learning more and more about Fuse.

I'm using [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) for geting the scheduele and standings data.

## ToDos
- Code cleanup/refactoring.
- Finish the view for the scheduele.
- Finish the view for the standings.
- Remake the menu.
- When clicking on one of the races, more info will pop up as weather, time etc.
